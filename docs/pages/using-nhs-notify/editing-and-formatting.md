Email templates can include:

- [bullet points](#bullet-points)
- [headings](#headings)
- [horizontal lines](#horizontal-lines)
- [inset text](#inset-text)
- [numbered steps](#numbered-steps)

Letter templates can include:

- [bullet points](#bullet-points)
- [headings](#headings)
- [horizontal lines](#horizontal-lines)
- [inset text](#inset-text)

## Guidance

### Bullet points

Use bullet points to help words or phrases stand out in your emails and letters.

You can either:

- add the same bullet points to every message you send
- add personalised bullet points each time you send a message

Copy this example to add bullet points:
[inset text component here]
Introduce bullet points with a lead-in line ending with a colon:

• leave one empty line space after the lead-in line
• use an asterisk or a dash followed by a space to add an item
• start each item with a lowercase letter, do not end with a full stop
• leave one empty line space after the last item

[end inset text]

To create sub-items, add an indent of 2 spaces before the asterisk or dash.

### Headings

Use a heading to tell recipients what your email or letter is about.

For emails, use subheadings to break up the rest of your content. Your first subheading must come after a heading.

For letters, use headings to break up the rest of your content.

Write all headings and subheadings in sentence case.

Use one hash symbol followed by a space for a heading in emails and letters, for example:

[inset text]
| # This is a heading

Use 2 hash symbols followed by a space for a subheading in emails, for example:

[inset text]
| ## This is a subheading

### Horizontal lines

Use a horizontal line to create separate sections in an email template.

To add a horizontal line between 2 paragraphs, use 3 dashes. Leave one empty line space after the first paragraph. For example:

[inset text]
| First paragraph
| ---
| Second paragraph

### Inset text

Use inset text to differentiate a block of text from the content that surrounds it, for example:

- quotes
- examples
- additional information

To add inset text, use a caret. For example:

[inset text]
| ^ You must tell us if your circumstances change.

Use inset text very sparingly – it’s less effective if it’s overused.

There’s more guidance about inset text in the GOV.UK Design System.

### Numbered steps

Use numbered steps instead of bullet points to guide a user through a process, or when the order of the items in a list is relevant.

You do not need a lead-in line for a numbered list.

Copy this example to add numbered steps:

[inset text]
| 1. Leave one empty line space before starting your list.
| 2. Enter a number followed by a full stop and a space to add an item.
| 3. Start each item with a capital letter and end it with a full stop.
| 4. Leave one empty line space after the last item.

To create sub-items, add an indent of 2 spaces before the number.

There’s more guidance about numbered lists in the GOV.UK Design System.

### Page breaks

To insert a page break in a letter template, use 3 asterisks. For example:

[inset text]
| Content on page 1
| •••
| Content on page 2
