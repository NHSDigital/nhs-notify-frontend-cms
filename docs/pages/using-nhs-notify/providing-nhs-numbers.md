You only need a patient's NHS number to send them messages.

NHS Notify finds people's contact details using their NHS numbers in the Personal Demographics Service (PDS).

## How to provide recipients' NHS Numbers

### If you're using the API

Send recipients' NHS numbers as part of your request.

Our API documentation shows the format to use.

### If you're using MESH

If you're using the Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH), upload NHS numbers in a CSV file.

The onboarding team will give you an example CSV file on request.

Use the format shown in the API documentation.
