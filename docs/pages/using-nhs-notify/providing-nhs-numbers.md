You only need a patient's [NHS number](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service/nhs-number) to send them messages.

NHS Notify finds people's contact details using their NHS numbers in the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service).

## How to provide recipients' NHS numbers

### If you're using the API

Send recipients' NHS numbers as part of your request.

Use the format shown in the
<a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-notify" target="_blank">API documentation (opens in a new tab)</a>.

### If you're using MESH

If you're using the [Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh), upload NHS numbers in a CSV file.

The onboarding team will give you an example CSV file on request.

Use the format shown in the
<a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-notify" target="_blank">API documentation (opens in a new tab)</a>.
