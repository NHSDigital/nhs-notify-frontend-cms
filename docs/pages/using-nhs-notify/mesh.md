NHS England organisations and services can use the Message Exchange for Social care and Health (MESH) to send messages with NHS Notify.

You should only use MESH to send messages if your organisation or service does not:

- have a developer
- need the features offered by our API

Check if MESH is right for you by contacting our engagement team.
