It can take different amounts of time for messages to be delivered depending on the message channel.

## NHS App messages

NHS Notify can send NHS App messages to recipients with the NHS App at any time.

If a recipient has notifications turned on, they’ll also receive a push notification.

Push notifications are only sent to recipients between 6am and 10pm. If you send a message outside of these hours, the notification will be sent from 6am.

### Open rates and click-throughs

We do not track open rates and click-throughs because of privacy issues. Tracking emails without asking permission from users could breach General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).
