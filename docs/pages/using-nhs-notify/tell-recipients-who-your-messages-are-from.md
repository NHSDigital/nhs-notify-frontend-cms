It’s important that your recipients know and trust who has sent them a message.

You can change the:

- [NHS App sender name](#nhs-app-sender-name)<!-- markdownlint-disable-line -->
- [text message sender name](#text-message-sender-name)
- [reply-to email address](#reply-to-email-address)

## Return addresses

You cannot change the return addresses of letters. These are set by NHS Notify’s suppliers and are printed on the envelopes.

## NHS App sender name

The NHS App uses your service or organisation’s ODS code to set up your NHS App message sender name.

NHS Notify will ask you for your ODS code during onboarding.

Find your ODS code with the [ODS Portal](https://odsportal.digital.nhs.uk/).

## Text message sender name

You can set your text message sender name during onboarding.

If you need to set up a different text message sender name for another batch of messages, contact our onboarding team.

## Reply-to email address

You can choose the email address that your emails are sent from and if your recipients can reply to it.

Emails with a reply-to address seem more trustworthy and are less likely to be labelled as spam.

You'll set your reply-to email address during onboarding.

If you want to allow recipients to reply to your emails, your service or organisation must have appropriate processes in place.
