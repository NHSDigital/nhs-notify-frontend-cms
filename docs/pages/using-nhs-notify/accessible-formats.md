Before you start to send messages, consider the access needs of your recipients.

All organisations that provide NHS care or publicly-funded adult social care are legally required to follow the [NHS England's Accessible Information Standard](https://www.england.nhs.uk/about/equality/equality-hub/patient-equalities-programme/equality-frameworks-and-information-standards/accessibleinfo/).

## Accessible letter formats

NHS Notify offers the following letter formats so you can reach people with access needs.

| Accessible format    | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| Large print  | Letters that have a larger font than usual. Large print letters typically have a point size of 16 and above.    |
| Braille | Includes the original letter and a Braille insert. NHS Notify uses the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to translate your content into Braille so that blind and partially sighted people can read your messages.    |
| Audio CD | Includes the original letter and a CD that plays a spoken recording of your letter's content.  |

## Other accessible formats

You can include links in your messages to take recipients to other accessible formats such as:

- easy read
- British Sign Language (BSL)

You’ll need to arrange these accessible formats. NHS Notify does not provide them for you.

This is available for NHS App messages, emails, text messages and letters

## How to send messages in accessible formats

### 1. Tell us if you’ll need accessible formats

Do this by:

- speaking to our engagement team when you first [get started]({% link pages/get-started/get-started.md %}) with NHS Notify
- raising a [Service Now request](https://nhsdigitallive.service-now.com/csm) if you're already using NHS Notify and have existing templates

### 2. Create your templates and routing plans

Set up a routing plan that requests accessible formats.

Create separate templates for each type of accessible format you’ll need. Select the ‘standard letter’ template type.

### 3. Provide recipients' NHS numbers

Provide recipients' NHS numbers as separate data files for each type of accessible format.

### 4. We'll check for recipients with access needs

It’s your responsibility to message recipients based on their access needs.

NHS Notify can check who needs accessible formats, but we’ll only send them an accessible format if you've created a template that matches.

We’ll send the accessible letter format if:

- you've given us the accessible template
- PDS confirms there are recipients with access needs

We’ll send the standard letter if you've not given us the accessible template, even if PDS says there are recipients with access needs.
