| You can request additional languages, as long as they're in PDS. We’ll need to test these languages so make sure you leave enough time for this.

## How to send letters in other languages

### 1. Create your templates

You're responsible for translating your message content. NHS Notify does not offer a translation service.

Create your messages using standard templates.

You’ll need to include both the English version and the translated version in a single template.

The letter will be on double-sided paper.

Aim to keep your message content to 2 double-sided sheets to save costs. This will include the English version on one double-sided sheet and the translation on another double-sided sheet.

### 2. Find recipients who need letters in other languages

NHS Notify checks recipients’ language preferences in PDS.

You can decide whether to message recipients based on their language preferences.

We’ll send the letter with the translation and the English version if you've given us the translation and PDS says it's the recipient's preferred language.

We’ll send the letter in English if you've not given us the translation, even if PDS says the recipient has another preferred language.
