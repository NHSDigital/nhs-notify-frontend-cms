You can send personalised messages using a single template.

To personalise a message, use double brackets to add a placeholder to your content. For example:

[inset text here]
| Hello ((firstName)), your NHS Number is ((nhsNumber))

NHS Notify uses the Personal Demographics Service to find and populate certain personalisation fields.
