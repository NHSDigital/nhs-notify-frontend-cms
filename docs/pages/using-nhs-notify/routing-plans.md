You'll need to create a routing plan to decide how messages will be sent to your recipients.

Setting up a routing plan can make your messages more effective and sometimes lower messaging costs.

You can set up routing plans to:

- use certain templates for specific groups of recipients
- message a recipient with each channel in the order you choose
- set up fallbacks for messages that fail
- stop sending messages after a chosen channel is successful
