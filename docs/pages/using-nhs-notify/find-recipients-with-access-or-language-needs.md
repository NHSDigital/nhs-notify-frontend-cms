NHS Notify identifies people who need messages in accessible formats or other languages (sometimes called preferences).

We check this information using the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service).

You need to decide whether to message recipients based on their access or language needs.

## Sending messages in accessible formats and other languages

We’ll only send messages in [accessible formats]({% link pages/using-nhs-notify/accessible-formats.md %}) or [other languages]({% link pages/using-nhs-notify/letters-in-other-languages.md %}) if you’ve created templates that meet recipients’ access or language needs.

## Message channel preferences

NHS Notify does not currently check for recipients’ message channel preferences, for example NHS App, email, text message or letter.
