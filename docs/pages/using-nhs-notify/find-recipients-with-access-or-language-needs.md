NHS Notify identifies people who need messages in accessible formats or other languages (sometimes called preferences).

We check this information using the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service).

You need to decide whether to message recipients based on their access or language needs.

## Sending messages in accessible formats and other languages

To send messages in accessible formats or other languages, you need to create templates for them.

Read more about sending messages in [accessible formats](/using-nhs-notify/accessible-formats) or [other languages](/using-nhs-notify/letters-in-other-languages).

## Message channel preferences

NHS Notify does not currently check for recipients’ message channel preferences.
