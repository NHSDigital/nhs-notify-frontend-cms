## Push notifications

The NHS App will send push notifications to your recipient’s device whenever you send them an NHS App message.

Recipients can choose if they want to receive notifications or not in the NHS App. Depending on their choice, NHS App messages will push a banner notification and badge notification to their device.

### Banner notifications

Banner notifications are short messages that appear on the lock screen of a recipient’s device. They show the recipient that there is an unopened message waiting in their NHS App inbox.

To protect recipients, banner notifications pushed by the NHS App never include any of your message content.

### Badge notifications

When a recipient receives a NHS App message, a badge notification will appear on the NHS App icon. Badges let NHS App users know that there’s an unopened message or notification for them in the app.
