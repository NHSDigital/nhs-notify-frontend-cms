Use NHS Notify to send:

- [NHS App messages](/features/nhs-app-messages)
- [emails](/features/emails)
- [text messages (SMS)](/features/text-messages-sms)
- [letters](/features/letters)

## Send messages in bulk to different audiences

You only need a person’s NHS number to send them messages. Choose who you want to message by providing NHS numbers.

## Write your messages

Create reusable templates for the message channels you want to use.

Once you’ve created a template you can:

- [edit and format your messages](/using-nhs-notify/editing-and-formatting)
- [add personalisation](/using-nhs-notify/personalisation)
- [include links and URLs](/using-nhs-notify/links-and-urls)
- [add email branding](/using-nhs-notify/email-branding)
- [add letter branding](/using-nhs-notify/letter-branding)
- [tell recipients who your messages are from](/using-nhs-notify/tell-recipients-who-your-messages-are-from)

## Plan how your messages will be sent

Routing plans allow you to send messages to audiences more effectively and sometimes at lower costs.

You can set up routing plans to:

- use certain templates for specific audiences
- message a recipient with each channel in a specific order
- set up fallbacks for messages that fail
- stop sending messages after a channel is successful

## Prevent sending people unnecessary messages

NHS Notify uses the Personal Demographics Service to automatically prevent you from messaging recipients you cannot message.

## Reach audiences with additional needs

You can use NHS Notify to:

- [find recipients with access or language needs](/using-nhs-notify/find-recipients-with-access-or-language-needs)
- [send letters in other languages](/using-nhs-notify/letters-in-other-languages)
- [send letters in accessible formats](/using-nhs-notify/accessible-formats)

## See how your messages perform

Track how many messages you’ve sent and find out which ones are not being delivered.

## Automatic sending

To send messages automatically, you’ll need a developer to integrate with the NHS Notify API.

[Read our API documentation (opens in a new tab)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-notify).
