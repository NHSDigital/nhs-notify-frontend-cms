NHS England organisations and services have an annual allowances of free text messages.

The current allowance is:

- 30,000 free text messages for national services
- 10,000 free text messages for regional services

When a service has used its annual allowance, it costs 2.27 pence (plus VAT) for each text message you send.

You may pay more for each message, if you:

- send text messages longer than 160 characters
- use certain signs and symbols
- use accents and accented letters

## Long text messages

If a text message is longer than 160 characters (including spaces), it counts as more than one message.

## Signs and symbols

The following signs and symbols count as 2 characters each: []{}^\|~€

Using them can increase the cost of sending text messages.

## Accents and accented characters

Some languages, such as Welsh, use accented characters.

The following accented characters do not affect the cost of sending text messages: Ä, É, Ö, Ü, à, ä, é, è, ì, ò, ö, ù, ü.

Using other accented characters can increase the cost of sending text messages.
