## Letter inserts

You can include an insert with letters to give recipients other information. For example, this could be a leaflet to a related service.

If you include an insert with your letter, you will need to pay an insert fee of up to 1.08 pence + VAT for each letter.

You can print your inserts elsewhere or use NHS Notify. If you use NHS Notify, you will need to pay the print cost.

## Returned letter costs

There is an 18 pence charge for each letter you send that is returned. Returned letters are then destroyed for data security, which costs £5.99 + VAT for every 10,000 letters.

Letters are sometimes returned because:

- the address is invalid or does not exist
- it has been refused by the recipient
- the address is vacant or the recipient is no longer there
